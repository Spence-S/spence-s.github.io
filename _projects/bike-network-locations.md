Built an API for a programming contest that focused on using git and github and project management.
The competition is currently underway and winning team will win a $300 amazon gift card.
The team split the work and I wrote the backend with Node.JS and the other team
members contributed to the front end. The competition is still underway.

The competition was hosted by the full-stack-network twitch channel. Which is an
amazing community for programmers of all levels and backgrounds.
