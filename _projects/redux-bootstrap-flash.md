redux-bootstrap-flash is a small react-redux component that allows you to quickly implement a flash messaging system in your bootstrap@3 styled applications. It's tiny and dead simple to use and has minimal configuration.

Just dispatch the flash action and the next user click, the flash message will disappear. It's as simple as that!

Works perfect with any redux integrated bootstrap3 or react-bootstrap application and can quickly and effectively get feedback to your users with minimal interruption to your UI.
