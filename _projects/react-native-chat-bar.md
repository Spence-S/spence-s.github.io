React Native Chat Bar is a multi component utility bar for a chat application. It is fully featured with a camera, GIF search powered by giphy (react-native-giphy), and camera roll access.

The UI is intuitive and simple and powerful and can give any basic chat UI a more modern feel without all the legwork.

The API is intuitive and simple, but can be completely customized through an easy to understand prop configuration.
