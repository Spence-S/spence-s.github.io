A simple node starter project that handles user management with Facebook login.

Built with Node, Mongo as a DB and Mongoose.

Enables out of the box user accounts that pulls information from facebook and
or allows user to submit the information. Gives user a simple, account.

Styled minimally for greater customization to fit the needs of the application.
