When I am learning new things there is one thing that has consistently slowed me down. It's not a bad trait or something that should be shamed at all. It is just a beginners mind set. See, whenever I learn something new I always try to be too idiomatic with the tech that I am learning.

This is you not applying a fundamental rule of programming to the way you learn. "Do not optimize too early." This is repeated over and over again. Why? Because engineers lose too much time trying to do things the best way when they really just need to do the damn thing.

I am this way 100% when it comes to learning. Instead of just digesting the content, and learn the axioms of the technology I am learning. I am hell bent on making everything perfect the first time.

The fact is, when you are learning a complicated technology you cannot learn both the best practices and the tech at the same time. They are two different paradigms. Instead, get off your programmer, "im so smart" high horse and just vomit out some spaghetti code until you know the new language. Then once you are confident in getting a program running with the new tech, then start learning how to make it pretty and nice.

Learning any tech is not a sprint. It is ALWAYS a marathon. If it isn't a marathon, then you aren't really learning, you are just being a copy pasta dev and it won't matter if your code is good any ways.

So do yourself a big favor, and instead of trying to do things the best way whenever you are learning. Just learn the syntax and major points through and through and give yourself permission to write fucking ass shit code. Whenever you get the fundamentals solid, then start looking at scaled out projects and finding the best ways to do something.
