        Much less mysterious than the title the catchy title would lead one to believe, I am
        just a pretty normal guy. And, as a normal guy, I like most normal guy things. Things like my
        lovely girlfriend, my amazing genius sweetest-dog-in-the-world dog, Duchess, working out,
        drinking a cold beer on the weekends, and finding the fun in the little things in life.

          However, there is a much darker side to me. A side of me that likes to sit and contemplate
          a multitude complicated minutae into the early hours of the morning. A side that keeps me from
          getting sleep. A side that makes me anti-social, and even stranger, happy to be that way. This dark side,
          is really not so dark at all. In fact, it's almost certainly the side of me you
          are most interested in reading about, and the reason there is even anything here to read.
          All of this side of me stems from one thing. I. f***ing. love. to. write. code.

      tldr: You really should read the long version, but, if your'e in a hurry, here's the skinny: I taught myself to program throughout 2015-16 by sloppily
      clanking my keyboard 20-40 hours a week, on top of working a full time job and involving myself in the developoer community in a myriad of ways.

          <h3>2004</h3>
          I was in the hottest one of the hottest rock bands in the Ledford Senior High School. Clearly, we had the best website made by yours truly.
          These were times when CSS was barely a thing. I laid out our website with beautiful tables and tags and photoshopped images of text.
