        Much less mysterious than the title the catchy title would lead one to believe, I am
        just a pretty normal guy. And, as a normal guy, I like most normal guy things. Things like my
        lovely girlfriend, my amazing genius sweetest-dog-in-the-world dog, Duchess, working out,
        drinking a cold beer on the weekends, and finding the fun in the little things in life.

          However, there is a much darker side to me. A side of me that likes to sit and contemplate
          a multitude complicated minutae into the early hours of the morning. A side that keeps me from
          getting sleep. A side that makes me anti-social, and even stranger, happy to be that way. This dark side,
          is really not so dark at all. In fact, it's almost certainly the side of me you
          are most interested in reading about, and the reason there is even anything here to read.
          All of this side of me stems from one thing. I. f***ing. love. to. write. code.

      tldr: You really should read the long version, but, if your'e in a hurry, here's the skinny: I taught myself to program throughout 2015-16 by sloppily
      clanking my keyboard 20-40 hours a week, on top of working a full time job and involving myself in the developoer community in a myriad of ways.

          I was in the hottest one of the hottest rock bands in the Ledford Senior High School. Clearly, we had the best website made by yours truly.
          These were times when CSS was barely a thing. I laid out our website with beautiful tables and tags and photoshopped images of text. It was hosted
          on angelfire. It was beautiful. It even had a cool flash plugin on the landing page!

          <h3>2006</h3>
          I started school as a young freshman in an undeclared engineering major at my alma-mater NCSU. I wasn't sure what I wanted to be when I grew up.
          I'm still not sure, but I know that my next few years will be dominated by web development and javascript.

          <h3>2008</h3>
          Joined biomedical engineering track at NCSU and took a multitude of classes based around programming with Matlab. I guess this isn't proper for the time line per se, but I had to point out
          that engineering in general, not just computer science, teaches programming. I used Matlab to model biological systems and represent data from research. Later I would use it extensively for
          learning signal processing.

          <h3>2011</h3>
          Graduated with a degree in Biomedical Engineering with a focus on instrumentation and signal processing. Whoo! Still had no clue what I was going to do with myself, but I knew I had
          significant training in engineering disciplines that were steeped in logical thinking and math.

          <h3>2011</h3>
          Started work as a biomedical technician in a hospital near where I lived. The career path was to get into clinical engineering and one day become a manager. Time played out and that
          didn't seem so attractive. I was yearning for something much more technically and mentally challenging.

          <h3>2012-13</h3>
          Decided I would try my hand at graduated school. I didn't join the program, but instead took some graduate classes in computer engineering. Took classes on DSP in Matlab, which laid foundations for understanding complex algorithms and intro to
          systems programming. I decided after a year of fulltime work in addition to studies, it didn't make financial sense to quit my job to get a masters degree. I felt a bit lost.

          I started looking for ways to change careers when I stumbled upon marketing material online. I learned SEO and did a bit of client work for small businesses. I wasn't Studied programming concepts and dove into learning javascript. Spent many hours pouring through
          books and completing projects while working an unrelated full time job.
