# Creating the CSS timeline

I felt my CSS was getting a bit rusty, and making the nice timeline that you
can see on my about page was a fun challenge and getting lots of practice with
child and pseudo CSS selectors!

## The timeline container

The timeline container fits easily enought into a full length bootstrap 4 row and col-12.

``` sass
.timeline{
  position: relative;
}
```
